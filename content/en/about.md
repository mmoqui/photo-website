My name is Miguel Moquillon and I'm living, currently, near Grenoble.

If I have a great intimacy with the writing, it is by the image I have chosen to express myself. In my childhood, I liked to draw. Currently, I have chosen the photography.

The photographic books and the exhibitions opened my eyes to a whole world of possiblities, free of conventions and rules. I understood the power the images and the series can have. That a photograph only comes to live when it is printed on a physical medium, by its very texture.
