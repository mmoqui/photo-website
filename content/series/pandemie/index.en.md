summary: 'March 2020, everything is turning upside down. "The world before" is passing away and the new one is in making... March 2020, and the world is at standstill. The empy streets. The traffic lights at deserted intersections. The days pass and look the same. At home. With the familly. Pacing around. Keeping himself busy. Eating. Playing. Working from home. One single autorized hour to go outside within a limited perimeter. In the countryside, in the mountains, we can easily stretch our legs. From lockdowns to ends of lockdown, these years of pandemic will have left their mark on each of us but not in a similar way. This series is to tell my own experience of this very special period.'
