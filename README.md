My photography website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and it's based upon the [Ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme.
It is a photoblog in which each post is a serie of photographs on a given subject.
It uses the [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) Javascript gallery and lightbox to provide a slideshow of the photographs of a serie.

You can visit it at [https://photo.moquillon.fr](https://photo.moquillon.fr).
